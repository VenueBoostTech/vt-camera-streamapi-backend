# VisionTrack AI Model Training Guide

This document outlines the process for training AI models for VisionTrack, including details on the models, their types, and the current training progress.

## AI Models Overview

VisionTrack utilizes the following AI models, each designed for specific business applications:

-   **FOOTPATH_TRACKING:** Tracks movement patterns and preferred paths.
-   **DEMOGRAPHICS:** Analyzes age and gender distributions.
-   **FACE_DETECTION:** Detects and analyzes faces while preserving privacy.
-   **HEATMAP_GENERATION:** Creates visual heatmaps of people density.
-   **SHOPLIFTING_DETECTION:** Identifies suspicious shoplifting behaviors.
-   **PEOPLE_COUNTER:** Counts people entering and exiting spaces.
-   **CHECKOUT_COUNTER:** Monitors checkout queue times and efficiency.
-   **GENERAL_OBJECT_DETECTION:** Detects and tracks various objects.
-   **VEHICLE_DETECTION:** Detects and tracks vehicles in parking areas.
-   **PPE_DETECTION:** Detects the use of personal protective equipment.


## Training Process

The training process involves the following steps:

1.  **Data Collection:** Gather relevant video and image data for each model.
2.  **Data Annotation:** Annotate the collected data with bounding boxes and labels using tools like Roboflow or similar.
3.  **Model Training:** Train the models using frameworks like YOLOv8, TensorFlow, or PyTorch, depending on the model's complexity and requirements.
4.  **Model Evaluation:** Evaluate the trained models using metrics like mAP, precision, recall, and F1-score.
5.  **Model Optimization:** Fine-tune the models based on the evaluation results to improve performance.
6.  **Model Deployment:** Deploy the optimized models for use in the VisionTrack system.
